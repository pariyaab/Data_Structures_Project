## projects desciption
### Five Way Partition
In this project, we should complete body of FiveWayPartition method in FiveWayPartition.h file and a result that by this function should be produced is :
elements in array that enterd as a input to this function should be sorted in this way :
1. all elements that are less than pivot1 should be in range(p,q-1) index
2. all elemnts that are equal pivot1 should be in range(q1,q2-1) index
3. all elemnts that are less than pivot1 and greater than pivot2 should be in range(q2,q3-1) index
4. all elemnts that are equal pivot2 should be in range(q3,q4-1) index
5. all elemnts that are greater than q2 should be in range(q4,r) index
all of these rules should done just by one iteration on input list.

### Heap Sort
In this project, we should complete functions sort,initlize,insert and deleteMax about heapsort algorithm and output of all function that mentioned before should be like that :
converts the array corresponding to Heap Max into an ascending array.

### Linked Linear List
In this project, we should write Doubly circular linked list with header node data structure consist of remove and add method  for both forward iterator and backward iterator in o(1) time complexity.

### Two Stack Expression Evaluation
In this project, we should to implement the two-stack algorithm of Dijkstra's railway yard to convert an infix into a postfix form.
