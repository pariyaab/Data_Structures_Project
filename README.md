### Five Way Partition
In this project, we should complete the body of the FiveWayPartition method in FiveWayPartition.h file and a result that by this function should be produced are:
elements in the array that entered as a input to this function should be sorted in this way :
1. all elements that are less than pivot1 should be in range(p,q-1) index
2. all elements that are equal pivot1 should be in range(q1,q2-1) index
3. all elements that are less than pivot1 and greater than pivot2 should be in range(q2,q3-1) index
4. all elements that are equal pivot2 should be in range(q3,q4-1) index
5. all elements that are greater than q2 should be in range(q4,r) index
all of these rules should be done just by one iteration on the input list.


### Heap Sort
In this project, we should complete functions sort,initialize, insert and deleteMax about the heapsort algorithm, and the output of all functions mentioned before should be like that :
converts the array corresponding to Heap Max into an ascending array.

### Linked Linear List
In this project, we should write a doubly circular linked list with a header node data structure consisting of the remove and add method for both forward iterator and a backward iterator in o(1) time complexity.

### Two Stack Expression Evaluation
In this project, we should to implement the two-stack algorithm of Dijkstra's railway yard to convert an infix into a postfix form.
