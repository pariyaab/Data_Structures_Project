### five way partition
in this project we must complete body of FiveWayPartition method in FiveWayPartition.h file and a result that by this function should be produced is :
elements in array that enterd as a input to this function should be sorted in this way :
1. all elements that are less than pivot1 should be in range(p,q-1) index
2. all elemnts that are equal pivot1 should be in range(q1,q2-1) index
3. all elemnts that are less than pivot1 and greater than pivot2 should be in range(q2,q3-1) index
4. all elemnts that are equal pivot2 should be in range(q3,q4-1) index
5. all elemnts that are greater than q2 should be in range(q4,r) index
all of these rules should done just by one iteration on input list.
